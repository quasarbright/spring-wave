# spring-wave

wave physics simulator to demonstrate wave phenomena like diffraction and double slit interference. the wave is just a bunch of balls attached to each other via springs. There are walls, which don't move and are not attached to balls, screens, which are just balls shaped like tall sticks, and controlled balls, which move according to some function, rather than the physics.
